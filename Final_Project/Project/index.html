	<h1>The Pine Box: Pouring Great Beer Since March 2012</h1>

<p id="homepar">We are proud to be a part of our Capitol Hill community and Seattle's history.  Built in 1923 this colonial style building of vaulted ceilings and leaded glass windows was once the new expansion of E.R Butterworths and Sons Family Funeral Business.  The main interiot serves as their chapel, seating over 350 mourners, and included a pipe organ (above the kitchen) and a choir loft (above the main entrance).  The bar itself and many of the tables are built from reclaimed oak coffin cabinents once housed downstairs where the "processing" took place.  The ceramic block marked "33" located between our draft screens was part of the original urn storage.  As noted by local historian Clarence Bagely in 1929, this was the "first business to offer comprehensive death-related services from corpse retreival to coffin slaes." On July 31, 1971 Butterworth and family provided these services to the family and loved once of Bruce Lee. Among his pallbearers were Steve Mcqueen, James Coburn, Chuck Norris and Lee's brother Robert.Cheers to those still here and those who were.  </p>
